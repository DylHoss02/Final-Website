<h1>About The Band</h1>
<p>Queens of the Stone Age was formed from the ashes of lead singer Josh Homme's last band Kyuss. They debuted in 1998 with their self titled album.
they would later release their sophmore album "Rated R" which would get them a little bit of fame but nothing like their next album. 
at this time ex Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl would talk about how much he liked Queens which would lead to him being invited to drum on their next and 
biggest album "Songs For the Deaf". This was their breakout album that put them into the mainstream and is still considered by many as their best. </p>
